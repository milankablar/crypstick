Science, or SCIENCE!
The human genome (the genetic code in each human cell) contains 23 DNA
molecules (called chromosomes), each containing from 500,000 to 2.5 million
nucleotide pairs. DNA molecules of this size are 1.7 to 8.5 cm long when
uncoiled - about 5 cm on average. There are about 37 trillion cells in the
human body, so if you were to uncoil all of the DNA encased in each cell
and place the molecules end to end, it would sum to a total length of
2x1014 meters - enough for 17 Pluto round-trips (the distance from the sun
to Pluto and then back again is 1.2x1013 meters). As an added bonus, you
should know that we each share 99% of our DNA with every other human - just
to show that we're far more alike than different.
